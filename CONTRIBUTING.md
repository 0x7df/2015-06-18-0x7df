# How to Contribute

Software Carpentry is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons,
fixes to existing material,
bug reports,
and reviews of proposed changes are all equally welcome.

By contributing,
you are agreeing that Software Carpentry may redistribute your work under
[these licenses](LICENSE.md).

## Getting Started

1.  We use GitHub flow to manage changes,
    which is explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project)
    in Scott Chacon's book *Pro Git*.

2.  You should branch from and submit pull requests against the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

## Other Resources

1.  This lesson is based on the template found at
    [https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template).
    That repository has instructions on formatting and previewing workshop websites.

2.  For a list of helpful commands run `make` in this directory.
